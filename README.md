# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic and simple two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. 

Objective
The goal of the game is to be the first player to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

How to Play
Players: There are two players. One uses "X" and the other uses "O".
Turns: Players take turns placing their mark (either "X" or "O") in an empty square on the 3x3 grid.
Winning: The first player to align three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
Draw: If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
